# Binomial Distribution
# Q1.10 unbiased coins are tossed simultaneously ,find the probability that 
# there will be i) exactly 5 heads ii) At least 8 heads 
# iii) not more than 3 heads iv) At least one head. 
# V) If this exercise is carried out 50 times, how many times we can get 
# exactly 5 heads?
# dbinom


# Problem 2:

# Ravi and Lata want to play the 'The Minion Game'.

# Game Rules

# Both players are given the same string s.

# Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string s.

# Ravi has to make words starting with consonants.

# Lata has to make words starting with vowels.

# The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

# Scoring

# A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string s.

# For Example:
# String  s = BANANA

# Ravi's vowel beginning word = ANA

# Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, ravi will get 2 Points.

# Only aeiou are considered as vowels here

# Print name of winner the score of the winner

# In case draw print names of both and score
